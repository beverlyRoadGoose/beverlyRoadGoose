- Hello 👋🏾 &nbsp;I'm Tobi, a Software Engineer based in Berlin. 
- Currently, I'm building stuff at [Spotify](https://www.lifeatspotify.com/). 
- Outside of programming, I enjoy discovering [good music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeaDE1magRk). I share my favorites as curated playlists that I like to call [Paracosms](https://www.heytobi.dev/paracosms).
